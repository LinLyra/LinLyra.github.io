# 🌌 Lyra’s Universe

*In the vastness of space and the immensity of time, the chance to share the same planet and a moment with you is my greatest honor.*

Hi, I’m **Lyra**. I learn, analyze, and build — turning curiosity into projects that connect **data** with **people**.  
This site is my little cosmos: a place to explore what I’m studying, making, and thinking about.

## 🪐 Five Planets

- **Learning** — courses and self-study that shape my foundations in algorithms, statistics, and ML.  
- **Data** — notebooks, experiments, and stories from datasets to insight.  
- **Business** — cases, research, and structured thinking for real-world decisions.  
- **Product** — prototypes and small tools, often with GenAI, from idea → flow → ship.  
- **Nebula** — talks, workshops, volunteering, and sparks of curiosity.

## ✨ What I care about

- Learning fast and sharing clearly.  
- Evidence before opinions; prototypes before promises.  
- Building things that help — even if small.

## 🔭 A few themes you’ll notice

- Analytics that become decisions  
- GenAI explorations (agents, retrieval, prompts)  
- Friendly UIs for ideas and insights

# 🌌 Lyra’s Universe

*In the vastness of space and the immensity of time, the chance to share the same planet and a moment with you is my greatest honor.*

Hi, I’m **Lyra** ———— a student who loves working with data, seeing not just numbers but the stories and opportunities they reveal. I enjoy exploring how insights can shape industries and create value for people. At the same time, I’m a full-stack developer, able to turn ideas into real products that others can use.

## ✨ In this universe…

If something sparks an idea, leave your mark among the stars: draw a few glowing orbs on the canvas. Each one becomes a tiny nebula in this universe—your signature in my sky.

If you want to talk, send a message. Share a link, a question, a wild hypothesis, or just say hi. I read everything.

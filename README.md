# 🌌 Lyra’s Universe

*In the vastness of space and the immensity of time, the chance to share the same planet and a moment with you is my greatest honor.*

Hi, I’m **Lyra**. I learn, analyze, and build — turning curiosity into projects that connect **data** with **people**.  
I’m always exploring—following threads across the fields I love: data & optimization, statistics & time series, product & human-centered design, and the business questions that give models a purpose. This site is my little cosmos: a place to explore what I’m studying, making, and thinking about.

## 🪐 Five Planets

- **Learning** — courses and self-study that shape my foundations in algorithms, statistics, and ML.  
- **Data** — notebooks, experiments, and stories from datasets to insight.  
- **Business** — cases, research, and structured thinking for real-world decisions.  
- **Product** — prototypes and small tools, often with GenAI, from idea → flow → ship.  
- **Nebula** — talks, workshops, volunteering, and sparks of curiosity.

## 🌌 In this universe…

If something sparks an idea, leave your mark among the stars: draw a few glowing orbs on the canvas. Each one becomes a tiny nebula in this universe—your signature in my sky.

If you want to talk, send a message. Share a link, a question, a wild hypothesis, or just say hi. I read everything.

What I hope to build here is simple: a place where curiosity travels, where evidence beats opinion, and where small, kind tools help people think better together. If that resonates, you’re already part of this galaxy. ✨
